Release notes for version 1.3

    Minor bug fixes and functionality improvements:

    Entering empty QSO record bug fixed. To record QSO by "Enter" key 3 characters required in CallSign field; by "Log" button 1 character required in CallSign field.
    CW speed and CW macro Stop moved from the APP main interface to CW macro window.
    DXCC list can now be updated by user (via Settings->DXCC). There is no option for user to add new or delete old DXCC entry (if this is needed, please log issue request)
    ADIF fields compliance with version 3.1.3 ADIF specification verified (as per https://adif.org/313/ADIF_313.htm)
    3.1.3 ADIF Contest list embedded
    Log duplicates verification implemented: App displays warning under CallSign field if the following condition matched: 'CallSign', 'Band' and 'Mode' parameters already present in the log. Important - duplicate check does not verify the Date at this stage, this functionality will be added later. Hence, it is recommended to export ADIF on daily basis for contests.
    SRX, SRX_STRING, STX and STX_STRING parameters implemented in App interface (reflecting in ADIF export)
    BAND_RX implemented; works only when usinf VFO A / VFO B of TX1. Does not work at this stage with RIT/XIT and TX2 (this will be expanded in future versions).
    Common, DXpedition, IOTA DXpedition and Contest modes implemented (under "Mode" menu in Settings)
